A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
Following are the criteria for checking the password:
1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
Example
If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
Then, the output of the program should be:
ABd1234@1

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Question:
You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and height are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:
1: Sort based on name;
2: Then sort based on age;
3: Then sort by score.
The priority is that name > age > score.
If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
Tom,19,80
John,20,90
Jony,17,91
Jony,17,93
Json,21,85
Then, the output of the program should be:
[('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
We use itemgetter to enable multiple sort keys.

Question:
Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 7, between a given range 0 and n.

Hints:
Consider use yield

Question£º
A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps. The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
¡­
The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program to compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.
Example:
If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
Then, the output of the program should be:
2

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.


Question:
Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically. 
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.
Then, the output should be:
2:2
3.:1
3?:1
New:1
Python:5
Read:1
and:1
between:1
choosing:1
or:2
to:1

Hints
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Question 23
level 1

Question:
    Write a method which can calculate square value of number

Hints:
    Using the ** operator

Question:
    Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it, you can read document online or find some books. But Python has a built-in document function for every built-in functions.
    Please write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents, such as abs(), int(), raw_input()
    And add document for your own function
    
Hints:
    The built-in document method is __doc__
Question:
    Define a class, which have a class parameter and have a same instance parameter.

Hints:
    Define a instance parameter, need add it in __init__ method
    You can init a object with construct parameter or set the value later

Question:
Define a function which can compute the sum of two numbers.

Hints:
Define a function with two numbers as arguments. You can compute the sum in the function and return the value.

Question:
Define a function that can convert a integer into a string and print it in console.

Hints:

Use str() to convert a number to string.

Question:
Define a function that can convert a integer into a string and print it in console.

Hints:

Use str() to convert a number to string.


Question:
Define a function that can receive two integral numbers in string form and compute their sum and then print it in console.

Hints:

Use int() to convert a string to integer.
Question:
Define a function that can accept two strings as input and concatenate them and then print it in console.
Hints:
Use + to concatenate the strings


Question:
Define a function that can accept two strings as input and print the string with maximum length in console. If two strings have the same length, then the function should print al l strings line by line.

Hints:


Question:
Define a function that can accept an integer number as input and print the "It is an even number" if the number is even, otherwise print "It is an odd number".

Hints:

Use % operator to check if a number is even or odd.

Question:
Define a function which can print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 3 (both included) and the values are square of keys.

Hints:

Use dict[key]=value pattern to put entry into a dictionary.
Use ** operator to get power of a number.


Question:
Define a function which can print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys.

Hints:

Use dict[key]=value pattern to put entry into a dictionary.
Use ** operator to get power of a number.
Use range() for loops.
